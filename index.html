    <p> Gangle, I didn't think I was going to like her as much as I do, but for some reason I find Gangle to be the most relatable character in the show. </p>
     <p>I found her kind of interesting, but she didn't really stick out to me because of her short amount of screentime and because of how weak and a crybaby she is, but I unfortunately came to the conclusion that if I was anyone in this wonderful show then I would probably be her.</p>
    <p>For those who don't know, Gangle is one of the main characters of the show "The Amazing Digital Circus" on Youtube. A show that really goes into the depth and mentality of each prisoner in the digital penetentiary.</p>
    <p>Now for the reasons I relate to Gangle in extremely neccessary bullet points.</p>
   <p>1. She is an artist and likes drawing anime or cartoons.</p>
   <p>2. Using her masks, she presents herself as a happy comical person, but the mask can easily break into a depressed and low energy version of herself.</p> 
   <p>3. We can both be pretty silly and crazy when nothing stops us.</p>
   <p>4. We both struggle a little with loving ourselves from time to time.</p>
   <p>5. She can get a little bossy and perfectionist when in a position of power.</p>
   <p>6. Can eventually become happier with the help of close friends.</p>
